An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects)

Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes.

The super keyword is used to access properties on an object literal or class's [[Prototype]], or invoke a superclass's constructor.

The super.prop and super[expr] expressions are valid in any method definition in both classes and object literals. The super(...args) expression is valid in class constructors.

The extends keyword is used in class declarations or class expressions to create a class that is a child of another class.
